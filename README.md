The daily agenda.

Time of day: 09:15AM
Location: At the office
Status: Tired, hungry
Schedule: ?

With this daily agenda, the user is able to input their schedule and keep it stored on the site.
Whenever the user wants to know what time it is currently, they can look at the header and see the current time as it ticks away every second.
The user will know that everything scheduled in the past is no longer active and cannot be adjusted or added.
    HOWEVER
        The user is able to add/subtract/adjust their schedule within the current hour and the following hours within the day.
        The user will not have to worry about losing the data they stored into the page, all is saved to their localStorage.


Time of day: 4:00PM
Location: Office
Status: Tired
Schedule: Time to wrap up and go home.

The user has now been able to see all the appointments, reminders, and other schedules the user needed and cannot change the information.
        The boxes are also greyed out, indicating that this is the past.

4:00PM is currently showing Red to help the user see that "THIS IS THE CURRENT TIME, IF YOU HAVEN'T ALREADY, GO TO THESE APPOINTMENTS, DO THESE REMINDERS."
5:00PM is currently green because it lets the user know that this time block can be adjusted and is coming up.


Time of day: 6:17PM
Location: Home
Status: Exhausted, hungry
Schedule: TBD

The user is now unable to make adjustments since now that all the text-blocks are greyed out. This is because it is not work hours.


Time of day: 10:30PM
Location: Home, in Bed
Status: Sleepy, full
Schedule: Sleep

The user is now able to rest easily knowing that their busy schedule is organized and constantly alerting the user of current reminders/appointments and future reminders/appointments.

Rest well user,
    Tomorrow is another day to use and follow this daily agenda.
